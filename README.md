# React Native Template (v 0.64)

This is my custom template for new React Native apps. This template includes:

-   React Native 0.64

-   TypeScript

-   React Navigation

-   Redux (with Redux Persist and Redux Toolkit)

-   React Native SVG (with React Native SVG Transformer)

-   Reanimated 2

-   Axios as my preferable HTTP client

# Usage

```bash
react-native init MyApp --template eqlion/eqlion-template
```

Afterwards, if you use any custom fonts, place them inside `assets/fonts` folder and run `react-native link`

# Other

I will try to keep this template updated to the best of my abilities
